# Cplusplus-Projects
#### This repository contains the project folders and code for the various C++ projects that I have done. It also contains Arduino projects which are created in the Arduino IDE, which uses C++.
#### Description of the various projects that are inlcuded in this repository:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Project_BookInventorySystem: 
###### This project is a practice project in which a "database" is created of books and functions can be performed on those books.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Project_GuessingGame: 
###### This project is a practice project in which the user has 5 guesses to correctly guess a number. A random number between 1-100 is picked by the program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Project_MatrixCalculator: 
###### This project is a practice project that works with matricies. It contains self made functions in order to accomplish matrix math. This project was used as a practice project to help work with classes, and vectors (specifically a vector of vectors).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Project_TLEReader: 
###### This project is a practice project in how to read in files using C++. The file that is read in is a TLE file of the ISS. The data in the TLE is then extracted and put into another text file.

### Arduino Projects


#### LCD-Thermistor Project 
###### In this project a thermistor is used to take temperature readings. Those readings are then converted into Celsius and Fahrenheit. They are then displayed onto a 16x2 LCD display.

#### Ultrasonic Sensor-Stopwatch Project 
###### In this project a stopwatch timer is created in the code. The running time is then displayed onto a 16x2 LCD display. The user specifes when the stopwatch should start by typing the "START" command. The stopwatch stops when the Ultrasonic Sensor detects an object within 5 cm. The point of the Ultrasonic sensor is to act as a "finish line" that stops the time when something crosses in front of it.
